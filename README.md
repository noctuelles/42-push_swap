# 42-push_swap

The goal of this project is to imagine  an algorithm to sort in ascending order a set of numbers passed in the program parameter.
We can only use a limited set of instruction, which made this project tricky.

You can implement a sorting algorithm or imagine / be inspired by another algorithm to make your own.

## Advices

My first advices for this project is to **resist the temptation** of watching pre-existing push_swap project on Github.

On the other hand, i highly recommand you to talk with your peers about their project (even if they watched something on the web about the project).
This is far more interesting. Of course, looking on the web is also learning from your peers (if they're at 42), but i think you'll miss all the joy exchanging
with others in real life at school.

The web is amazing, but it made us lazy, and we're loosing the feeling of "the young Steve Jobs discovering something amazing in his garage.".

I'll allow myself on this project to look on the web and insprire from others after a long research of my own. 

Do whatever you want to do, but be aware of your own choices and their consequences, and your vision of 42.

## My first naive approach

This one is not effective at all.

I can sort a set of 10 000 numbers in **12451813** operations, and a set of 100 numbers in **1447** operations.
