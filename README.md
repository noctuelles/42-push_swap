# 42-push_swap

The goal of this project is to imagine  an algorithm to sort in ascending order a set of numbers passed in the program parameter.
We can only use a limited set of instruction, which made this project tricky.

You can implement a sorting algorithm or imagine / be inspired by another algorithm to make your own.

## My first naive approach

This one is not effective at all.

I can sort a set of 10 000 numbers in **12451813** operations, and a set of 100 numbers in **1447** operations.
